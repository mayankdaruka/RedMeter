# RedMeter
This is web application made using the Flask framework that performs sentiment analysis on tweets about Trump from 5 Texan cities (Houston,
Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Austin) in real time and visualizes the data on a map.
I trained the Keras model using the Sentiment140 dataset which can be found on Kaggle. The model was saved as "model.h5" but I was unable
to upload it to GitHub due to its large file size.
